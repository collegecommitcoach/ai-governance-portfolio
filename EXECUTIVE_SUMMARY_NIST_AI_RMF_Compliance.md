| **Feedback Reasons** | Categorization when negative feedback given | ✅ Live |
| **Report AI Issue** | User-initiated incident reporting from anywhere in app | ✅ Live |

### Admin Monitoring & Controls

| **AI Feedback Dashboard** | Review and analyze all user feedback | ✅ Live |
| **AI Incident Dashboard** | Track and manage reported issues | ✅ Live |
| **Emergency Kill Switch** | Disable all AI features instantly | ✅ Live |
| **Individual Feature Toggles** | Enable/disable specific AI systems | ✅ Live |

### Quality Assurance

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Algorithm Validation System** | Test recommendation quality across profiles | ✅ Live |
| **Validation Profiles** | 100+ test profile combinations | ✅ Live |
| **Results Dashboard** | Visualize validation outcomes | ✅ Live |

## 📊 Algorithm Validation Results

**Test Run:** November 24, 2025

| Metric | Result | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Profiles Tested | 100 | ✅ |
| Zero-Result Profiles | 0 | ✅ Full Coverage |
| Avg Recommendations/Profile | 10 | ✅ Healthy |
| Overall Avg Match Score | 89.44 / 100 | ✅ Appropriate |
| Match Score Range | 73.6 - 95.0 | ✅ 21+ point differentiation |

**Key Finding:** Algorithm successfully differentiates by academic and athletic credentials:
- Higher-qualified profiles (GPA 3.6+, Athletic 7-10): Match scores 93-95
- Mid-qualified profiles: Match scores 84-93
- Lower-qualified profiles (GPA <2.5, Athletic 1-3): Match scores 73-85

This differentiation is **intentional and correct** - the algorithm SHOULD provide different recommendations based on qualifications.

## 🛡️ Privacy-by-Design Implementation

### Data NOT Collected

LAX Commit Coach intentionally excludes protected demographic data:

| Data Type | Status | Implication |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Gender | Not collected | Product scoped to men's lacrosse |
| Race/Ethnicity | Not collected | Algorithm cannot discriminate |
| Household Income | Not collected | Algorithm cannot discriminate |
| Disability Status | Not collected | Algorithm cannot discriminate |

**Result:** The recommendation algorithm cannot discriminate on protected demographics because it has no access to this information. This is verified through algorithm validation testing.

### Data Collected (Recruiting-Relevant Only)

- Academic profile (GPA, test scores)
- Athletic profile (position, measurements, stats)
- Preferences (division, region, school size, setting)
- 12 importance weights (user-defined)
